1. What is the Java Collections Framework? Explain its advantages.
Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces that provide ready-made data structures to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.
Java provides built-in collection classes like List, Set, Map and Queue, so developers don’t need to write their own data management algorithms.

Advantages
-> The Collection Framework improves productivity by making code more reusable, maintainable and faster to develop.
-> Offers interfaces (Collection, List, Set, Map, Queue) to define standard behaviors.
-> Supports dynamic resizing, unlike arrays with a fixed size.
-> Includes algorithms (sorting, searching, iteration) via the Collections utility class.
-> Improves code reusability and performance by reducing boilerplate code.


2. List the differences between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet.

✅ 1. Vector
✔ Stores elements like an array
✔ Maintains order
✔ Allows duplicates
✔ Thread-safe → means safe for multi-thread apps
❌ Slow because every operation is synchronized

🔹Example use: older applications needing thread safety


✅ 2. ArrayList
✔ Stores elements in order
✔ Allows duplicates
✔ Faster than Vector
✔ Good for quick access by index
❌ Not thread-safe
❌ Insert/delete in between is slow

🔹Best when:
You want fast search/access
Insert/remove is rare


✅ 3. LinkedList
✔ Uses nodes linked together
✔ Allows duplicates
✔ Fast for insert/delete
❌ Slow for accessing by index (must traverse)
❌ Uses more memory (extra pointers)

🔹Best when:
You add/remove elements often
Less searching


✅ 4. HashSet
✔ Stores unique items only
❌ No duplicate allowed
❌ No indexing
❌ Order not guaranteed
✔ Very fast for add, remove, search
✔ Uses hashing internally

🔹Best when:
You need unique data
Order does not matter
